Hey there 👋  
I'm a 21 y/o CS student, passionate about building cool stuff on the internet, exploring open source, and constantly learning along the way.  

My Journey So Far  
Started my journey with DSA and competitive programming in my first year (March 2024), solving problems ( [Proof](https://codolio.com/profile/5TCQCjMM) ) and participated in multiple hackathons (Lol, I din't win, but learned a lot)  strengthening my fundamentals. Later, I discovered the open-source community — and honestly, I loved it. Since then, I've been contributing actively to cloud-native technologies and backend systems.

I briefly interned at a "two-days-ago funded startup," but I realized I wasn't learning much, so I left to dedicate my time fully to open source.  

Here's a list of well-known organizations I've contributed to:  
- @kubernetesio ( [Link](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag) ) 
- @KnativeProject ([Link](https://github.com/knative/func/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag))  (Due to my active and valuable contribution , Invited to join the organisation in less than 2 months)
- @project_harbor ( [Link](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag) )  
- @kagent_dev ( [Link1](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kmcp/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag), [Link2](https://github.com/kagent-dev/website/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag), [Link3](https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag) )
- @argo-cd ( [Link](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag) )
- @harbor-satellite ( [Link](https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-satellite/issues?q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag) )
- @headlamp-k8s ( [Link](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins/issues?q=is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Aintojhanurag) )

The number is still increasing — and it won't stop. (Reach out to me , i will show you my latest work) 

I've also built several projects along the way:  
- (**One-Password**)[https://github.com/intojhanurag/one-password]  
- (**npm-regret**)[https://github.com/intojhanurag/npm-regret] 
- (**Yt-Learn**)[https://github.com/intojhanurag/Yt-Learn]
- (**Agent-Cloud**)[https://github.com/intojhanurag/agent-cloud]
- (**spiffe-fun**)[https://github.com/intojhanurag/spiffe-fun]
- Plus many DevOps-related projects you can explore on my GitHub.  

I've worked with MERN and Go, explored C++, and a bit of machine learning (during first year through a couple of courses). I'm currently locked in for the next 6 months, practising algorithms, diving into CS fundamentals, and learning cloud-native technologies. I also write tech blogs on Medium ( [Link](https://medium.com/@aojharaj2004) )

Right now, I'm focused on becoming great at communication, speaking at cloud-native meetups ( [first_talk](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cloud-native-luxembourg-presents-inside-knative-from-contributor-journey-to-serverless-in-action/) ), and exploring the intersection of tech and business.  
So yeah — "You can just do things."  

Feel free to connect with me on my socials, always open to chat, collaborate, or just geek out over cool tech stuff.
